The pharmaceutical company that employs us has 4 main departments: sales department, research and development department, general management department and 
human resources department. From these departments we are interested to know where the company's offices are located, the number of vendors working in it, 
the income and expenses (in general), the rate of production of medicines, the number of factories it has and finally which are the authorized distribution 
companies.

These Distributors are those companies that distribute medicines by country, from the factory to the pharmaceutical warehouse (or state pharmacy). 
Therefore, we are interested in knowing the available distribution points, the location of the warehouses, the distribution range, the average expected 
time of shipment of medicine and the maximum capacity of their facilities.

State Pharmacy is the state's pharmacy in which, unlike private pharmacies, it concerns high-cost medicines. We are concerned about its location and the 
maximum capacity of the facilities, the distribution capacity (customer coverage range) and the cooperating Sharers.

For the patient we are interested in his name, which doctor he sees, his age, gender, phone number, how long he takes the company's drugs, if he took another 
drug of another company.

The doctor is the mediator between the seller and the patient. For him we need the name, his specialty, his years of experience, the address of the doctor's 
office, who the sellers who visit him and the number of cases he has concerning the drug.

For the seller we need his name, years of experience in the company, his salary, what drug of the company they have assigned him.

Finally, the drugs have a name, serial number, price and what are its characteristics, which company it is and whether it is approved.

A seller visits several doctors. While a doctor has several patients and at the same time can promote more than 1 drug of the same company. But a patient cannot 
take more than one medicine and sellers are allowed to visit the same doctor. The medicines reach the patients from the state pharmacies while the distributors 
are responsible for transporting medicines from the company to the state pharmacy. The company works with many distributors, and distributors ship the drugs to 
many state-run pharmacies. The company consists of, among other things, the sellers.

Medicines are produced by the company, distributed by distributors promoted by sellers, prescribed by doctors provided by state pharmacies and consumed by patients.
