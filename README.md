The pharmaceutical company that employs us has 4 main departments: sales department, research and development department, general management department 
and human resources department. From these departments we are interested to know where the company's offices are located, the number of vendors working in it, 
the income and expenses (in general), the rate of production of medicines, the number of factories it has and finally which are the authorized 
distribution companies. 
 
These Distributors are those companies that distribute medicines by country, from the factory to the pharmaceutical warehouse or to the state pharmacy. 
Therefore, we are interested in knowing the number and location of the warehouses, the distribution range, the number of trucks, the average expected time 
to ship medicine and the maximum capacity of their facilities. 

State Pharmacy is the state's pharmacy in which, unlike private pharmacies, it concerns high-cost medicines. We are concerned about its location and the 
maximum capacity of the facilities as well as the distribution capacity and the cooperating Sharers. 
 
For the patient we are interested in his name, which doctor he sees, his age, gender, how long he takes the company's drugs, whether he took another drug 
of another company. 
 
The doctor is the mediator between the seller and the patient. For him we need the name, his specialty, the address of the doctor's office, who the sellers 
who visit him and the number of cases he has concerning the drug. 
 
For the seller we need his name, the years of experience in the company, whether he is a supervisor or not, in which area he is located (geographically), 
the number of drugs that have been sold by him and therefore the income he offered to the company and which drug of the company they have assigned to him. 
 
Finally, the drugs have a name, date it came out on the market, price and what are its characteristics along with the side effects and to whom it is addressed.
 
A seller visits several doctors. While a doctor has several patients and at the same time can promote more than 1 drug of the same company. 
But a patient cannot take more than one medicine and sellers are allowed to visit the same doctor. The medicines reach the patients from the state 
pharmacies while the distributors are responsible for transporting medicines from the company to the state pharmacy. The company works with many distributors, 
and distributors ship the drugs to many state-run pharmacies. The company consists of, among other things, the sellers. The drugs produced by the 
company distributed by distributors promoted by vendors prescribed by doctors provided by state pharmacies and consumed by patients.
