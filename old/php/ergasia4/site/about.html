                    <p>A seller visits several doctors. While a doctor has several patients and at the same time can promote more than 1 drug of the same company. But a patient cannot take more than one medicine and sellers are allowed to visit the same doctor. The medicines reach the patients from the state pharmacies while the distributors are responsible for transporting medicines from the company to the state pharmacy. </p>
